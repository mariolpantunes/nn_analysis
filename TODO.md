# In models
- update model construction
    - CNN/RNN/Dense can have dropouts

# For search (hyperparameters folder)
- predefine a number of random seeds to apply
- verify callbacks to save momentaneous research

# In datasets
- Define the pool of datasets used.
    - Create different preprocessings for each type of model and each dataset.
